Chapter 1
================
Question 1
An algorithm that's performance P and task T improves with experience E

Question 2
Problems with constantly adjusting parameters
Problems that would require complex rules to implement traditionally
Problems that are too complex for traditional approaches or have no known algorithms
Problems where the problem is not fully understood and output of a machine learning program could provide useful insights.

Question 3
A labelled training set is a set of data used for supervised learning problems that contains
feature data and the expected output (i.e the label) associated

Question 4
The most common type of supervised learning tasks are classification and regression

Question 5
4 types of unsupervised learning tasks are :
Clustering
Dimensionality reduction (feature reduction)
Visualisation
Association rule learning (finding links between data)

Question 6
Reinforcement learning would be used for this application because
the robot would be expected to figure out which policies would need to be
used in a variety of situations, which may or may not have collectable data

Question 7
Semi supervised learning

Question 8
Spam detection would likely fall in the supervised learning camp as training data with labels would be used
to generate the original model.

Question 9
An online learning system is a system is trained incrementally by feeding sequential data
into the system. This allows the system to learn about new data on the fly.

Question 10
Out of core learning is how a learning system would be applied to data that is too big
to fit in the memory of one machine. It would be used as part of a online learning system.

Question 11
Instance based learning algorithms

Question 12
A model parameter is a parameter used to help fit the input data to the output
a hyperparameter is used to limit the effect or effective size of the model parameters and is a part of the learning algorithm itself

Question 13
Model based learning algorithms look to fit mathematical models to the set of data for prediction
We would train these functions by minimizing the cost functions of a selected model.
The place input features (the equation variable) into the model to calculate an output prediction

Question 14
Insufficient training data
Non representative training data
Poor Quality data
Underfitting
Overfitting

Question 15
Correct fitting in training data but poor fitting in test data indicates poor generalisation
- Simplify the data
- Try to gather additonal training data
- remove noisy data points

Question 16
A test set is a subset of labelled data removed from training data used to validate
how well a trained algorithm generalised to the problem (generalization error).

Question 17
A validation set is similiar to an additional test set and is used to further test the generalisation
of different models and compare their performance.

Question 18
The hyperparameters selected may be too specific to this set and may not generalise well

Question 19
A cross validation set is a subset of the training data used to perform the same function as the validation set without a need to remove data from the training set.
Since subsets of the training data are used at random for this task you waste less training data for validation purposes
