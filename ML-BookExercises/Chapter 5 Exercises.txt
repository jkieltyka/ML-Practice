Question 1
The idea of an SVM is to fit the widest possible street between different classes. When using hard margins no instances can lie on the decision boundry.
Soft margins will allow some violations which will allow a wider street.

Question 2
Support vectors are the instances on the street that determine where the decision boundry is.

Question 3
SVM classifiers are easily affected by large varying scales as this will efectively narrow the street.
By scaling the variables tou can produce a much wider decision boundry.

Question 4
An SVM can output the distance from the instance to the test boundry, which can be used as a confidience score.
This score can't be converted directly into a probability. To do probabilities you will need to set the probability flag to true.

Question 5
This only applies to linear SVMs. It would be far more efficient to use the primal method for a large number on instances.

Question 6
In this instance you would want to increase the gamma or C hyperparameters as this will increase the influence of the similiarity features.

Question 7
Pass until covering the mathematics of SVMs
