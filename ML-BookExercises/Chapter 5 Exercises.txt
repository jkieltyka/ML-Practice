Question 1
The idea of an SVM is to fit the widest possible street between different classes. When using hard margins no instances can lie on the decision boundry.
Soft margins will allow some violations which will allow a wider street.

Question 2
Support vectors are the instances on the street that determine where the decision boundry is.

Question 3
SVM classifiers are easily affected by large varying scales as this will efectively narrow the street.
By scaling the variables tou can produce a much wider decision boundry.

Question 4
