Question 1
Assuming that the models are diverse enough you could expect that the models could be combined for a better result.
Each model will work better on certain instances and so combining them will allow for a more accurate result through voting or blending.

Question 2
Soft voting can occur when the classifiers output a prediction probability. In this case an average probability will be used to predict a class.
With hard voting the class with the most votes will be selected. 

Question 3
Bagging, pasting and random forest ensembles can be distirbuted over servers as they are independant classifiers.
Boosting and requires each classifier to be trained and tested for error before the next can be trained so this can't be distributed.
Stacking could be distributed at each layer but the individual layers would need to be sequential.
