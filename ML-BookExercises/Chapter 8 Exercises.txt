Question 1
The main motivations are:
-	Speed up training of algorithms
-	To visualize the data and gain insights on the most important features
-	To save space

Main drawbacks are:
- loss of information
- computationally expensive
- adds complexity to the data pipeline
- transformed features can be hard to interpret

Question 2
The curse of dimensionality is that the more features you have the further apart each instance is.
As a result it can be hard to not overfit the data without having lots of data to use.

Question 3
No, you are removing some of the data's variance when you map it to a lower dimensionality. 
As a result you are lossing some of the data which results in the inability to restore all the original data.

Question 4
Yes you can use PCA to reduce data that is highly nonlinear as generally you can remove a number of useless dimensions.
If there are no useless dimensions this may not be effective.

Question 5
This will depend on the dataset. If there are more dimensions in the data set that do not affect the variance of the overall data,
the amount of dimensions that could be removed will be increased.
