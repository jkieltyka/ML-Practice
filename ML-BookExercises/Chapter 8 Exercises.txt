Question 1
The main motivations are:
-	Speed up training of algorithms
-	To visualize the data and gain insights on the most important features
-	To save space

Main drawbacks are:
- loss of information
- computationally expensive
- adds complexity to the data pipeline
- transformed features can be hard to interpret

Question 2
The curse of dimensionality is that the more features you have the further apart each instance is.
As a result it can be hard to not overfit the data without having lots of data to use.
